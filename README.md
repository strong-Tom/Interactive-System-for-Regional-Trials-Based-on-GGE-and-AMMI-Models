# Interactive-System-for-Regional-Trials-Based-on-GGE-and-AMMI-Models
Convenient for agricultural experts to use GGE and AMMI models more conveniently

The front-end of this project is completed using Vue and the back-end is completed using DJango.

This includes the AMMI model, GGE model, and scatter plot,as shown in the following figure.Users can change various data in the panel according to their preferences.

You can also upload data themselves to verify the effect. If you want to upload data for use, the format of the data is shown in the following figure. Rows represent different varieties, columns represent different locations, and row names are optional. Column names need to be specified to distinguish different locations. The GGE model and AMMI model both use this format of data.

The scatter plot function can view the growth of samples of different tree species in different regions. The sample data that needs to be uploaded is shown in the following figure. Users need to upload the location label, variety label, as well as the height and diameter of the sample.
