# Interactive-System-for-Regional-Trials-Based-on-GGE-and-AMMI-Models
Convenient for agricultural experts to use GGE and AMMI models more conveniently

The front-end of this project is completed using Vue and the back-end is completed using DJango.

This includes the AMMI model, GGE model, and sample data. Users can directly download sample data to verify the effect, or upload data themselves to verify the effect. If you want to upload data for use, the format of the data is shown in the following figure. Rows represent different varieties, columns represent different locations, and row names are optional. Column names need to be specified to distinguish different locations.
